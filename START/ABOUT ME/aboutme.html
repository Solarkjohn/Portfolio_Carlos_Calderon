        <p>
            I am from Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Since I was young, I loved drawing and physical tasks that
            required
            assembling or creating. My family taught me the culture of effort, and every day is a testament to that. I
            am a
            deeply
            creative person with an innate passion for graphic and industrial design.

            My mind is constantly looking for new perspectives and approaches to tackle creative challenges. My
            creativity
            is
            combined with a high level of organization, allowing me to approach projects in a structured and efficient
            manner. My
            ability to make informed and strategic decisions reflects my intelligence in problem-solving. I always
            strive to
            reach
            exceptional standards in my work and bring innovative solutions to every project I am involved in.
